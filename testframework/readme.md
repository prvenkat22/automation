The framework is based on nightwatchjs and node.js. I have used Page Object Model for the tests, CSS for element identification.

**The following components are also used for:**
- nightwatch-vrt - To compare the screenshot against a baseline screenshot, mainly for assertions
- concurrently - To run tests concurrently with various configurations
